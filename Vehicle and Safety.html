            Space Horizon is a space tourism company that specializes in providing customers with the opportunity to 
            experience space travel. The company uses specially designed vehicles for space tourism, such as 
            reusable spacecraft, that are focused on safety and passenger comfort. Safety measures may include the use 
            of redundant systems, emergency procedures and protective shielding to protect passengers from the harsh 
            conditions of space. The company may also provide training and preparation for passengers before their trip,
            as well as support during the flight and after landing. Additionally, the company may also be subject to laws 
            and regulations regarding space tourism and must comply with them. It is important to note that space tourism 
            is still an emerging industry and safety standards may be still developing.
